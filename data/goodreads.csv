But I did not expect I would actually be able to relate and question some of my own experiences (even though I did not experience anything to that same level). It was really hard to listen to the author's recollection of her childhood and at times I would find myself mouth agape in pure shock between how horrid the author's parents treated her and how detached the events were described. For the rest of the book the author talked through her years of trying to heal after her diagnosis. I very much appreciated how candid the author was about her ups and downs, the methods that worked or didn't work for her, and especially her analysis of how race/mental health specifically for asians in America influence our childhoods and how that impacts how we deal with stress/problems as adults. <br/>In addition, I would recommend listening to the audiobook. There is a section of the book where actual therapy sessions are included and I really appreciated the bravery it took to allow outsiders listen to something so intimate. As someone who hasn't been in therapy, this part of the book really gave me insight into what goes on during therapy and how it can actually help someone work through their thoughts and feelings. Overall, I appreciate the bravery it took to convey her story of healing and finding self-love.",,,1,0

The writing throughout the book was great. Many of the quotes really stuck with me and I'll definitely have to go back and reread them. I know that this book is the first of many and that the world building is needed but at times progress through the book was slow. I still am looking forward to see how all the characters interact with one another and how everything comes together. ",,,1,0

Her unconscious want to grab the next rung in life to gain the approval and adulation of those around her, to follow the 'obvious' path, when she was younger, rung very similar to my experience in pursuing college and then graduate school. <br/>In addition, I enjoyed learning how she navigated life through college, life as a lawyer, and ultimately deciding to pursue a career that she felt she gained the most fulfillment from. Her doubt/questions about how much her job fulfilled her, while also acknowledging the reality of life's problems like money really hit home that feeling fulfilled in one's job was a privilege that not everyone can have. <br/>Her recount of campaigning and Obama's presidency definitely gave me a fresh perspective on the pressures that politics has on the people that aren't explicitly involved.

So maybe I'm biased but I really enjoyed this book. The heroine provided a fresh new perspective, she was strong-willed and didn't do anything stupid even after falling in love. I liked how both Wren's and Callum's characters progressed and their relationship was so cute. Their romantic moments were to die for. I was apprehensive at first because Wren's character seemed to have a lot more emotions and feelings than her 178 number seemed to suggest to me, but I got over it because the story was intriguing. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel (hopefully it's just as good).   ",,,1,0
